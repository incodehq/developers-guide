=== Story checklists ("definition of done")

Use the following checklist to identify the tasks that might need to be done in order to complete a story:

* Scoping
** which code module(s) are impacted
*** will code in >1 module be updated?
*** will new modules be created?
** will their be any database schema changes
*** and if so, have any database views been impacted?
** will there be any data migation?
** is this a new feature, or modifying an existing feature
*** how high is the overall risk?
* Follow xref:_design-coding-standards[design/coding standards]
* Documentation
** `README.adoc` for the module updated (if required)
** any incremental documentation (eg user guide) updated ?


[TIP]

We'll extend/refine this checklist in future...

This checklist should be consulted when the story is initially created, and reviewed again as the story is completed and goes into review (discussed below).
