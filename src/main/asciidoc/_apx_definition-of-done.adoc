== Story checklists ("definition of done")

[TIP]
====
We'll extend/refine these checklists in future; probably having different types of checklists for different types of stories.
====

=== Before you start

Use the following checklist to identify the tasks that might need to be done in order to complete a story:

* Scoping
** which code module(s) are impacted
*** will code in >1 module be updated?
*** will new modules be created?
** will their be any database schema changes
*** and if so, have any database views been impacted?
** will there be any data migation?
** is this a new feature, or modifying an existing feature
** can this story be split?

* Control / Risk Management
** how high is the overall risk?
*** new feature vs bug fix vs ...
** how will a feedback loop (typically be the business) be established
** can deployment be decoupled from release ("dark release")?
** how recover in case of issue when deployed


* QA
** what sort of automated tests are required to validate the work?
** what sort of supporting documentation is required (over and above the code)?


=== Once you're done (implementation review)

Use the following checklist to identify whether the work is complete:

* Does the implementation follow xref:_design-coding-standards[design/coding standards] ?

* Testing
** fixtures
** unit tests
** integration tests

* Documentation
** `README.adoc` for the module updated (if required)
** any incremental documentation (eg user guide) updated ?
