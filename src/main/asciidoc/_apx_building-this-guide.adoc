== Building this guide

:_imagesdir: images/

This guide can be generated using Maven; as simple as:

[source]
----
mvn
----

The PDF and html versions are created in `target/generated-docs`.

Alternatively, you can simply load up `src/main/asciidoc/README.adoc` into AsciidocFX and then manually save as PDF.
(Note that AsciidocFX uses its own template, so the PDF will be different to that created by Maven).
